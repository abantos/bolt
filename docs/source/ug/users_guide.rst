Bolt's User Guide
################################################################################

You've decided to use Bolt in your project (or maybe just try it out to see 
what it can do for you). Great! This is a great place to start. This section
will show you how to get started with Bolt and what it can do for you.

The following sections will drive you through the process of installing Bolt,
setup your first bolt task file, and start running automated tasks with Bolt.
They will show you how to use some of the tasks that are provided with Bolt,
and how to customize their execution. The :doc:`Getting Started <getting_started>`
section is a good start; then, you can dive into more advance topics.
